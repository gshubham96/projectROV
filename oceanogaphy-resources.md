# Oceanography Resources

A Non-Exhaustive list of open-source resources avaible for citizen scientists and hobbyists

1. [**ArduSUB**](https://www.ardusub.com): The ArduSub project is a fully-featured open-source solution for remotely operated underwater vehicles \(ROVs\) and autonomous underwater vehicles \(AUVs\). ArduSub is a part of the ArduPilot project, and was originally derived from the ArduCopter code. ArduSub has extensive capabilities out of the box including feedback stability control, depth and heading hold, and autonomous navigation. ArduSub is designed to be safe, feature-rich, open-ended, and easy to use even for novice users.
