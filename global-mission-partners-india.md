# An Indian Viewpoint

## Benefits to India and Indians[^1]

India is surrounded by 50% Coastline and is the namesake of one of the largest and most diverse oceans in the world.

Much of India's problems can be addressed through an intelligent and sustainable use of out oceans. Especially with India's growing youth population Oceans present themselves to be an excellent candidate for food sourcing, energy generation, and resource extraction. Much of our existing economic and commercial activities can be shifted to our water bodies which will provide us with more jobs and opportunities, while simultaneously preserving scarce land resources.

Offshore wind farms are an excellent example as they win over traditional wind farms in many aspects such as Higher & steadier wind speeds and closer proximity to human settlement means less energy transfer losses. The virtually infinite water mass can be tapped to our liking in a sustainable manner for ecological and economic development of India. Despite our easy access to the water, marine sciences remain a niche area of study with people not being aware or properly educated about the state of our oceans and the vast amount of benefits they offer us.

Our current lifestyle has threatened the very fabric of our water bodies, cursing us with coastal erosion, large-scale untreated industrial dumping and the rapidly degrading state of our national and local rivers. This brings with it catastrophic consequences to the environment and our country alike which deserved to be talked in detail over an article for itself. Contamination of Yamuna and Ganga, 2015 South Indian Floods and the current flooding of Mumbai can all be contributed to the irresponsible and illegal activities by corporations and public alike.

People who have experiences the underwater realm have often remarked it to be a world of its own. From ancient shipwrecks to giant sea creatures, the deep sea has much to offer. I for one particularly find the hydrothermal vents to be one of the natures most extreme form of expression. For all the wonders and glory the sea holds within, much of it was remained inaccessible until up to the 1960's when the development of UUVs was first prompted. Use of UUVs kicked of underwater exploration and gave rise to a whole new domain of science and technology. The fascinating and mind-whelming visuals of the world of the seas have definitely had a great impact in generating public interest in marine sciences.

If we spend some time looking at the current marine technology, we quickly realize much of it is dominated by the use of expensive and complex equipment. Despite being the earliest form of travel, sailing hobby remains expensive as ever.AUVs, ROVs and other vehicles which helps us explore the deepwater involve proprietary and expensive investment and thus often remain out of reach to even the well-funded organizations. With the advent of new semi-professional grade ROVs such as openROV and BlueRobotics, marine sciences have seen an unprecedented increase in community participation and through underwater photo-videography, the message has spread farther and farther. Both of the above-mentioned platforms support and promote opensource components and actively take part in and contribute towards the development of OS Components. However, due to the nature of the field itself, much of the domain remains specialized and expensive as compared to aerial and land-based vehicles.

Hobbyist UUV components despite being cheap are often inaccessible mainly due to low and limited availability. For a customer in India, ordering an item from a US-based company imposes many difficulties such as customs formalities, high shipping costs and often lack of appropriate payment portal. Whereas common electronic and mechanical hardware such as Pelican box, Raspberry Pi, PixHawk are available virtually every urban part of the world. Innovation needs to be applied not in finding new tools and equipment but rather exploiting existing technology to produce better results in the development of UUV domain.

With the technical know-how and experience I gained developing AUV Zariya at Team DTU AUV, often working under strict constraints of budget, tools, and hardware. I am on the quest to design a semi-professional grade ROV made from simple commercial off-the-shelf solutions paired with open sourced software under the price cap of INR 50,000 or USD 850.
