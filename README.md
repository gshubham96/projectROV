# ProjectROV[^1]

## Introduction

ProjectROV is an initiative to design an open source semi-professional grade ROV that can be readily made under the price cap of INR 50,000 or USD 800. ProjectROV has the following design objectives:

1. Implement and improve OS software systems when available, develop custom OS solutions where necessary
2. Maximize the use of commercially available, mass-produced components for ROV Design
3. xx
4. Bridge the Gap between Scientific and Citizen Scientist/Hobbyist community

## Concrete, Specific Outcomes of this Project

1. To design and develop
   1. An open-source freely available underwater platform accessible to the general public regardless of the geophysical location age, knowledge skill-set and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_[^2].
   2. or extend software package to accommodate hardware solutions and provide custom payload integration capabilities
2. To build ROV kits for use in education & research, photography, recreation, small-scale surveys and use in Boat & Yacht industry.
3. To provide a digital platform for
   1. interactive build guide for myROV platform
   2. discussion of ideas related to and troubleshoot issues of the myROV platform
   3. sharing community gathered data through myROV platform

## Project Ideology

The Ideology behind this project is to have a vehicle that is freely and easily available so that anyone can make one and start exploring the oceans. Among the few ROVs that exist for the general public, only handful of them utilize open-source components and hence accessibility to the public remains low. I aim to design an ROV that would be completely open source and made from commercially available off-the-shelf components. This would allow anyone anywhere in the world with access to basic technical skills and tools to build an ROV for ocean exploration.
