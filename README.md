# ProjectROV

## Introduction

ProjectROV is an initiative to design an open source semi-professional grade ROV that can be readily made under the price cap of INR 50,000 or USD 800. ProjectROV has the following design objectives:

1. Implement and improve OS software systems where available, develop custom OS solutions where necessary
2. Maximize the use of commercialy avaible, mass produced components for ROV Design

4. Bridge the Gap between Scientific and Citizen Scientist/Hobbyist community
5. xx

The Ideaology behind this project is to have a vehicle that is freely and easily available so that anyone can make one and start exploring the oceans. Among the few ROVs that exist for the general public, only handful of them utilize open-source components and hence accessibility to the public remains low. I aim to design a ROV that would be completely open source and made from commercially avaible off-the shelf components. This would allow anyone anywhere in the world with access to basic technological skills and tools to buld an ROV for ocean exploration.



If you see a \_\_\_\_\_\_, it probably means that I was not able to think of a better word at the moment and hence will try fill it up later.
