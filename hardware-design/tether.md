# Tether

The two major tether systems I've had a look at are

1. 2-wire ROV Tether by OpenROV + TopSide Interface Boards + Tenda Homeplug Adaptor ~ $155
2. Fathom ROV Tether +  Fathom Interface Boards ~ $1600

While the first one is badwidth limitations, the latter is too expensive to fit into out budget.

I hae read several blog posts about testing with fiber optic cable as an ROV tether but unfortunately no results are posted. Overall, I did feel a negative atmosphere for FO tethers mainly due to them being expensive, delicate and difficult to work with. While this was certainly the case few years back, I feel the price and avaibility and tools now avaible are much cheaper and hence this option can be considered. There still remains the problem of FO being too delicate.

I am planning to solve this by designing adaptors that would be fixed along the FO cable with a kevlar fishing line of sorts. The purpose of adaptors would be two fold

1. To distribute the weight, Pull/Push force on the tether among itself and the kevlar line
2. To effictively provide a  boyant tther by having net positive bouyancy.

Cost Analysis:

100m FO Cable = $55  
RJ45 - FO Interface = $45\*2=$90  
100m Kevlar Line = $50  
3D Printing = $55  
Total ~ $250  
Budget Target = $200
